          Web designers plan, create and code internet sites and web pages, many of which combine text with sounds, pictures, 
          graphics and video clips. A web designer is responsible for creating the design and 
          layout of a website or web pages. It and can mean working on a brand new website or updating an already existing site.
          Website designers may consider it to be good practice to conform to standards. This is usually done via a description specifying 
          what the element is doing. Failure to conform to standards may not make a website unusable or error prone, but standards can relate
           to the correct layout of pages for readability as well making sure coded elements are closed appropriately. This includes errors
            in code, more organized layout for code, and making sure IDs and classes are identified properly. Poorly coded pages are 
            sometimes colloquially called tag soup. Validating via W3C can only be done when a correct DOCTYPE declaration is made, 
          which is used to highlight errors in code. The system identifies the errors and areas that do not conform to web design standards.</p>
